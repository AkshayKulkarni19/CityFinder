# CityFinder

Search approach:  
- After reading json file data is converted into dictionary with alphabet as key & city lists with starts with alphabet as value. This improves performance of search any string with time complexity as O(k) where k is number of cities with alphabet starts which in linear search it could have been O(n) where n is total number of cities.
- Followed Clean MVP architecture for this assignment.
- UI/UX is not considered, but considered performance.
- Air distance is considerd to display distance in miles from user's current location.
